# Regression Analysis for Price of OLX Cars

## Objective

The primary objective of developing a regression model for predicting the resale price of used OLX Cars is to provide an accurate and reliable tool for estimating the market value of vehicles based on various features. This model aims to facilitate informed pricing decisions for both sellers and buyers in the OLX Cars marketplace. Specifically, the regression model aims to define accurate price prediction by developing a model that can accurately predict the resale price of OLX Cars based on relevant features such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and other significant factors. By achieving these objectives, the regression model aims to enhance the pricing transparency and efficiency in the OLX Cars marketplace, ultimately benefiting both sellers and buyers in making well-informed decisions regarding used car transactions.
