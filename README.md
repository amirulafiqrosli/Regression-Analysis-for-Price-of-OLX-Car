# Regression Analysis for Price of OLX Cars

## Objective

The primary objective of the diabetes classification analysis is to develop an accurate and interpretable machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on medical and demographic data. The aim is to create a reliable tool for healthcare professionals to identify individuals at risk of diabetes, utilizing features such as age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. The analysis involves training and optimizing a predictive model, assessing its generalization on validation data, identifying key predictive features, and ensuring interpretability. Additionally, the objective extends to providing actionable insights for healthcare practitioners, exploring correlations in the dataset, and addressing potential imbalances in positive and negative diabetes cases. Ultimately, the goal is to contribute to personalized treatment plans and enhance the understanding of relationships between various factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes.
